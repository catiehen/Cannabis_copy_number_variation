## Copy Number Variation in _Cannabis sativa_
### Background
Copy number variation (CNV) is a type of structural variation involving alterations in the number of copies of specific regions of DNA, which can either be deleted or duplicated. CNV's are defined as being 1 kilobase or larger and, in comparison to a reference genome, is present at a variable copy number. 

I intend on making an addition to the research of the _Cannabis sativa_ plant and use the bioinformatics tools, [indexcov](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/6/11/gix090/4160383) and [cn.mops](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cn.mops.html) to detect CNV's in hemp-type and drug-type strains of this species. 

I've created this repository as a resource of my work with these tools performed for the [Agricultural Genomics Foundation](https://www.agriculturalgenomics.org/) over the course of my research which began in May of 2019.
